# üç∑ Wine Quality Prediction Web App: Tuned Random Forest Classifier

## Project Overview

This project implements a robust **Tuned Random Forest Classifier** to predict the quality of White Wine. The focus was on optimizing model performance through rigorous hyperparameter tuning, which resulted in a **6% improvement** over the baseline model.

The final model, achieving **~81% accuracy**, is deployed within a lightweight Flask web application. Users can input various physicochemical properties (like alcohol content, density, and pH) and instantly receive a prediction of whether the wine is "Good" or "Bad."

The application is deployed end-to-end on Render, demonstrating full-stack ML deployment skills.

## Key Features

* **Optimized ML Model:** Utilizes a **Random Forest Classifier** where performance was boosted by **6%** via hyperparameter tuning and cross-validation, achieving a final accuracy of **~81%**.
* **Data Analysis Focus:** Trained on the UCI Wine Quality Dataset, focusing on five critical features (volatile acidity, chlorides, density, pH, and alcohol) identified through exploratory data analysis.
* **Web Interface:** A simple, responsive user-friendly Flask application with an HTML form (`index.html`) for real-time input and inference.
* **Production Deployment:** Fully containerized and deployed on Render (PaaS) for public access and Continuous Deployment practice.

## üìä Model Performance: Quantified Impact

The final Tuned Random Forest Classifier was rigorously evaluated on the held-out test set, demonstrating the value of hyperparameter optimization.

| Metric | Baseline Score | **Final Tuned Score** | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Accuracy** | ~75% (approx.) | $\mathbf{\approx 81\%}$ | **6% performance improvement** achieved through tuning. |
| F1-Score (Weighted) | N/A | $\mathbf{\approx 82\%}$ | High F1 score confirms robust performance on both Good and Bad classes. |
